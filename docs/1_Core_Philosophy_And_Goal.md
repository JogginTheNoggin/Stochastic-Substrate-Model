# Neuron Simulator: Core Philosophy and Goal

## [cite_start]1. Overarching Goal: Possibility not Probability 

[cite_start]The fundamental purpose of the Neuron Simulator project is to develop a C++ simulation framework designed as a testbed for exploring **emergent computational properties** within adaptive networks.

[cite_start]The guiding philosophy is **"Possibility not Probability"**. [cite_start]This means the primary objective is not to perfectly replicate known biological neural functions or guarantee specific learning outcomes, but rather to construct a system with the inherent **potential** for complex, perhaps unexpected, behaviors like self-organization, learning, and adaptation to arise naturally from the interaction of its defined components and rules. [cite_start]The framework aims to provide the necessary building blocks and flexibility for such possibilities to be investigated.

## [cite_start]2. Direction: Functional Abstraction 

[cite_start]To best serve the goal of exploring possibilities without getting bogged down in potentially unnecessary biological detail, the project has adopted a more **abstract, functional model**. [cite_start]This approach prioritizes simulating the core **functions** of information processing and timed communication within a network over mimicking the exact physical **form** of biological neurons.

## [cite_start]3. Intent: A Substrate for Emergence 

[cite_start]The intent is to build a computational substrate where interesting dynamics can develop organically. Key aspects include:

* [cite_start]**Emergence:** Complex behaviors should ideally arise from the defined interactions, not be explicitly programmed.
* [cite_start]**Adaptation:** The framework must include mechanisms allowing the network's parameters and structure to change over time based on activity or other rules.
* [cite_start]**Flexibility:** The architecture should be extensible, allowing future exploration by adding new operator types, payload properties, or update rules.
* [cite_start]**Consistency:** Simulation mechanics are designed to ensure consistent and deterministic behavior within discrete time steps, providing a stable base for complex dynamics to unfold.
* [cite_start]**Meta-Capability (Theoretical):** The design includes components (like the MetaController) that centralize network information, providing a theoretical avenue for the system to access and potentially act upon its own configuration or state.
